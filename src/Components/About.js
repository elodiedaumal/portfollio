        I'm a passionate, creative and multi-potencial skilled junior web
        developer. I set my new skill target a few years ago in digital
        technologies. Before changing my career path to code, I was SEO,
        copywriter and entrepreneur of my own business where I created more than
        70 niche websites using Wordpress. And Befor that I was a R&D chemistry
        tehnicien for big French companies.

        After finishing my studies of web development, front end is the part
        that I find most attractive and in which I want to deep in, grow as a
        dev and learn a lot more. However my curiosity knows no bounds and I am
        also exploring the back end of web development.

        In order to provide the best user experience, I like creating beautiful,
        interactive and functional interfaces. I also stand for quality,
        scalability and optimization of web apps following always Gitflow and
        agile methodologies. I love teamwork. To me learning is always fun, but
        learning and growing together as a team is another level of fun.
