        I'm a passionate and enthusiastic junior frontend developer. Before
        changing my career path to code, I was a wordpress web designer and
        creator. I created more than 70 niche websites and 30+ logos. Before my
        career as a web developer, I was still a puzzle solver as I was a R&D
        chemistry technician specialized in glass chemistry.

        I focused my studies to become a frontend developer. It is the part that
        I have found the most interesting so far. I can't wait to code amazing
        design and grow as a dev and learn a lot more. However, my enthusiasm
        knows no bounds. Therefore, I would be happy to learn about backend if
        gotten the opportunity.
      </p>

        In order to provide the best user experience, I like to create
        beautiful, interactive and functional interfaces. I also stand for
        quality, scalability and optimization of web apps following always
        Gitflow and Agile methodologies. I love teamwork. To me coding is like
        solving a puzzle, and I can't wait to solve puzzle together.
